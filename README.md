# F1_analysis
Hi!!

This is my simple data analysis project related to the 2024 Formula 1 season.

The data was scraped from the official website using Python, including BeautifulSoup, and then cleaned and transformed using Pandas.
The result was exported to an Excel file, and then I created a Power BI report showcasing a summary and a dedicated page for each team.

Here are some screenshots:
